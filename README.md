# 🏎️ BoxBox F1 Strategy Commander Game

This is the frontend for **BoxBox**, a game where users make strategy decisions in real F1 race scenarios — without knowing the driver or event until the end.

Players go through 5 curated scenarios per race and are scored based on how their decisions improve or worsen real outcomes. The top managers appear on a global leaderboard each day.
